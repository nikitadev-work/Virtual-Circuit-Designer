# AI Usage Report

ChatGPT was used to support the team throughout the project in the following ways:

- **Documentation assistance**: ChatGPT generated initial drafts of user documentation, technical overviews, and helped structure section templates. This included project introduction, setup instructions, sprint summaries, and retrospective sections.
- **Improvement of README files**: The AI was used to refactor and clarify README descriptions, making installation steps and usage examples more concise and understandable for new contributors.
- **Language refinement**: ChatGPT reviewed and edited English-language texts to ensure grammatical correctness and consistency across documentation.
- **Task descriptions and user stories**: Some Jira, GitHub issue descriptions, acceptance criteria, and user story summaries were formulated or polished with the help of ChatGPT.
- **Retrospective and reporting**: The AI provided structured templates and draft texts for sprint retrospectives and AI usage reporting sections.
- **Automation suggestions**: ChatGPT was consulted for best practices in test automation, CI/CD setup documentation, and for improving workflows described in the documentation.

All AI-generated content was reviewed and edited by team members before inclusion in the final project documentation.
