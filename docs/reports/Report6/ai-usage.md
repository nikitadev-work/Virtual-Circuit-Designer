**Tool:** OpenAI ChatGPT 03, used as an on-demand assistant for planning, documentation, and boilerplate code.

- **Backlog and Planning:** Transformed raw feature notes into structured GitHub issues (User Story + Acceptance Criteria + Test Case) and suggested initial story-point estimates.  
- **Documentation:** Generated first drafts of structure for the MVP 3 scopes: Sprint Review/Retrospective write-ups.  
- **Code Scaffolding:** Produced sample Jest/Supertest test files (60 LOC each) and outlined a refactor to remove a manual line comment (NoOp).  
- **UX Micro-copy:** Drafted tooltip text, error messages, and empty-state copy for the new dashboard list view.  

**Human Verification:** All AI-generated outputs were reviewed and edited by at least two developers or designers to ensure style, accuracy, and security before merging or releasing.
