# How AI Was Used in This Assignment
- **Report Structure:** Based on the assignment requirements, AI helped generate a logical structure for the PDF report and suggested the optimal order of sections.
- **Use Case Diagram:** During the planning phase, we described the system functionality in plain text, and AI converted it into PlantUML syntax for the use case diagram.
- **API Mocking:** AI provided sample REST endpoints for circuits (e.g., `/circuits`, `/simulate`, `/save`), which formed the basis for our Postman collection.
- **User Story Formulation:** AI assisted in rephrasing user stories into a clearer, consistent format (e.g., "As a user, I want... so that I can..." pattern).
- **Backlog Review and Refinement:** When reviewing our backlog, AI suggested breaking down certain user stories into smaller, more manageable tasks to better align with the Detailed principle of the DEEP methodology.
